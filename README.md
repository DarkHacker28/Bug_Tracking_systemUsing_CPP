Bug Tracking System

# Project Overview : 

The Bug Tracking System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to help software development teams track, manage, and resolve bugs and issues in their projects. The system is built using a combination of C++, Java, CSS, JavaScript, and various libraries to provide a seamless and efficient way to monitor the lifecycle of bugs from detection to resolution.

This system helps developers and project managers efficiently handle bug reports, prioritize them, assign tasks, and monitor the progress of fixes. It also includes automated bug detection mechanisms to identify issues within the system, enhancing both proactive and reactive bug management.

# Features :

Bug Reporting: Allows users to submit bug reports with details such as severity, description, steps to reproduce, and attachments.

Bug Tracking: Track the status of each bug (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).
User Management: Roles for users such as Admin, Developer, and Tester with specific permissions.
Search and Filter: Easily search and filter bugs by various attributes like severity, date reported, assignee, and status.Automated Bug Detection: The system automatically scans the application for common bugs using predefined rules and triggers.Notifications: Alerts users when a bug is assigned to them, updated, or resolved.
Task Assignment: Assign bugs to developers or testers and track their progress.
Technologies Used

# Backend :

C++: Used for developing the core algorithms and automated bug detection functionality.
Java: Utilized for building the server-side components and handling requests between the frontend and the database.
Frontend:

CSS: For styling the user interface and making the system visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: For handling dynamic interactions on the frontend, including form submissions, user notifications, and data visualization.
Other Libraries & Tools:

Node.js: For the backend server and managing dependencies.

React.js: For building the frontend components.

MySQL: For storing bug reports, user details, and system information.

Bootstrap: For responsive design and UI components.

# How It Works :

Bug Report Creation: Users can create a new bug report by filling in a form with details such as bug description, severity, and steps to reproduce.
Bug Assignment: Admins can assign bugs to specific developers or testers. The system allows filtering bugs based on severity and status to prioritize the most critical issues.
Bug Detection: The system runs automated checks to detect common issues and bugs in the system, highlighting potential areas that need attention.
Tracking & Updates: Users can track the status of each bug in real-time. The system sends notifications to users when there is an update on the bugs they are assigned to.
Bug Resolution: Once the bug is fixed, it is marked as resolved and can be closed after final verification.
